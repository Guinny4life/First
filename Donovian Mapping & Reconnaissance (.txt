Donovian Mapping & Reconnaissance (DMR)
XX OCT 2023
Start Time: 1300
Duration: 4 hours

Type of Operation: Scanning & Reconnaissance

Objective: To aid Gorgas Cyber Forces, you are tasked with collecting and analyzing data from Donovian cyberspace and networks. Using reconnaissance methods, build a comprehensive network map including networking devices and target hosts with the following details:

    Device type
    Hostname
    Interface type
    Interface IP
    Subnet Mask CIDR
    Autonomous system number, Routing Protocol, IP network, and Network Name groupings
    Open ports
    Operating system type and versions

Gathered Intelligence: Credentials
netX_studentX:passwordX
vyos:passwordtem

Tools/Techniques: dig, nmap, nc, /dev/tcp

Scenario Credentials: Perform DNS reconnaissance on your CTFd server to obtain the start flag.
The start flag is an encoded string stored in a DNS record associated with your CTFd server. Decode this string to retrieve the flag.

Prior Approvals: Use SSH to move through the network, but conduct all scanning from your RED-INTERNET-HOST.

Scheme of Maneuver:
> INTERNET_HOST
  → Red-Internet_Host: DONOVIAN Compromised Pivot
    → Red Boundary Router: DONOVIAN CYBERSPACE

Target Section:

DONOVIAN Compromised Pivot
Hostname: red-internet-host
IP: 10.50.189.76
Ports: 22
Action: SSH to pivot with X11 Forwarding (-X)
Example: ssh -X netX_studentX:passwordX@Pivot-IP
Run terminator from remote CLI to open a new terminal.
