First day, day one! Let's get this started, I can type with out looking at the keyboard. Oops I missed spelled without, like why is it just one word.

        OP NOTES
##Control Sockets
  ssh -MS /tmp/jump/ student@10.50.16.164        (M is multiplexing, to connect to multiple systems, S is socket created in /tmp directory)

##ping sweep from jump box
  for i in {97..126}; do (ping -c 1 192.168.28.$i | grep "bytes from" &); done       from jump box we can only pingsweep
                                                                                                                                                          .97, .100, .105, .111, .120

SITREP:Your team has been deployed for Operation Golden Nugget, in direct support of Gorgas forces amid the Donovian-Gorgas war. You have been tasked to collect, analyze, and process data utilizing various reconnaissance
techniques throughout Donovian and Gorgas Cyberspace.

Maintain 'low visibility' on the wire, as security products may be in place, and document your actions and results as you will be expected to provide OpNotes upon request.

Intelligence believes that not all of the 192.168.28.96/27 network has the ability to communicate with the 192.168.150.224/27 network.

Donovian Reconnaissance and Scanning (DR&S)
XX June 2024
Start Time: 1300
Duration: 4 hours

Type of Operation: Cyber Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C-ISR)

Objective:Scan target networks to gather pertinent host information.

Tools/Techniques: All connections will be established through network scans or web browser. Ports in use will be dependent on target location and are subject to change. Network scanning tools/techniques are limited 
to NSE scripts, python lxml and OSINT.

Scenario Credentials: FLAG = R3C0N5t@rt0F@ct1v1ty

Prior Approvals: OSINT through publicly available resources. Scrape appropriate web content that will provide operational data. Testing of found credentials. NOT approved to change routing, passwords, services, 
destroy data, upload of tools, create accounts
